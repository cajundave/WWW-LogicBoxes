=head1 NAME

WWW::LogicBoxes::Contact - Representation of Domain Contact

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use WWW::LogicBoxes::Customer;
    use WWW::LogicBoxes::Contact;

    my $customer = WWW::LogicBoxes::Customer->new( ... ); # Valid LogicBoxes Customer

    my $contact = WWW::LogicBoxes::Contact->new(
        id           => 42,
        name         => 'Edsger Dijkstra',
        company      => 'University of Texas at Austin',
        email        => 'depth.first@search.com',
        address1     => 'University of Texas',
        address2     => '42 Main St',
        city         => 'Austin',
        state        => 'Texas',
        country      => 'US',
        zipcode      => '78713',
        phone_number => '18005551212',
        fax_number   => '18005551212',
        type         => 'Contact',
        customer_id  => $customer->id,
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Representation of a L<LogicBoxes|http://www.logicboxes.com> domain contact.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 id

Contacts that have actually been created will have an id assigned for them.  A predicate exists 'has_id' that can be used to check to see if an id has been assigned to this contact.  A private writer of _set_id is also provided.

=head2 B<name>

=head2 B<company>

Company of the contact.  This is a required field so if there is no company some sentinal string of "None" or something similiar should be used.

=head2 B<email>

=head2 B<address1>

=head2 address2

Predicate of has_address2.

=head2 address3

Predicate of has_address3.

=head2 B<city>

=head2 state

This is the full name of the state, so Texas rather than TX should be used.  Not all regions in the world have states so this is not a required field, a predicate of has_state exists.

=head2 B<country>

The ISO-3166 code for the country.  For more information on ISO-3166 please see L<Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2>.

=head2 B<zipcode>

=head2 B<phone_number>

Be sure to include the country code.  When it comes to the phone number a string or L<Number::Phone> object can be provided and it will be coerced into the L<WWW::LogicBoxes::PhoneNumber> internal representation used.

=head2 fax_number

Predicate of has_fax_number

=head2 type

The type of contact, B<NOT TO BE CONFUSED> with what this contact is being used for on a domain.  This B<IS NOT> Registrant, Billing, Admin, or Technical.  The default value is 'Contact' and you almost never want to change this.

=head2 B<customer_id>

The id of the customer that this contact is assoicated with.

=head1 METHODS

These methods are used internally, it's fairly unlikely that consumers will ever call them directly.

=head2 construct_creation_request

    my $logic_boxes = WWW::LogicBoxes->new( ... );
    my $contact     = WWW::LogicBoxes::Contact->new( ... );

    my $response = $logic_boxes->submit({
        method => 'contacts__add',
        params => $contact->construct_creation_request(),
    });

Converts $self into a HashRef suitable for creation of a contact with L<LogicBoxes|http://www.logicboxes.com>

=head2 construct_from_response

    my $logic_boxes = WWW::LogicBoxes->new( ... );

    my $response = $logic_boxes->submit({
        method => 'contacts__details',
        params => {
            'contact-id' => 42,
        }
    });

    my $contact = WWW::LogicBoxes::Contact->construct_from_response( $response );

Creates an instance of $self from a L<LogicBoxes|http://www.logicboxes.com> response.

=head1 SEE ALSO

For .us domains L<WWW::LogicBoxes::Contact::US> must be used for at least the registrant contact.
