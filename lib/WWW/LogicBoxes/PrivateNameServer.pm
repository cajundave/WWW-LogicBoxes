=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WWW::LogicBoxes;
    use WWW::LogicBoxes::Domain;
    use WWW::LogicBoxes::PrivateNameServer;

    my $domain = WWW::LogicBoxes::Domain->new( ... ); # Valid LogicBoxes domain

    my $private_name_server = WWW::LogicBoxes::PrivateNameServer->new(
        domain_id => $domain->id,
        name      => 'ns1.' . $domain->name,
        ips       => [ '8.8.8.8', '2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8888' ],  # IPv4 and IPv6 are supported

    my $updated_domain = $logic_boxes->create_private_nameserver( $private_name_server );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Private Nameservers are those that are from the same domain as the L<registered domain|WWW::LogicBoxes::Domain>.  For example, a domain test-domain.com could have private nameservers ns1.test-domain.com and ns2.test-domain.com.

These nameservers must be "registered" with L<LogicBoxes|http://www.logicboxes.com> and it is the responsiblity of WWW::LogicBoxes::PrivateNameServer to represent all of the data assoicated with these registrations.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

The L<domain|WWW::LogicBoxes::Domain> id assoicated with the domain that this will be a private nameserver for (test-domain.com).

=head2 B<name>
